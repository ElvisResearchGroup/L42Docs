\textbf{Operator precedence}
\small\\*
Postfix unary operators (as method calls)
have the strongest precedence of all,
then prefix unary operators and finally binary operators.
A sequence of identical binary operators associate from left to right,
so that \Q@a+b+c@ is equivalent to \Q@(a+b)+c@,
but sequences of different operators with the same precedences, like \Q@a+b*c@, are not well formed.
