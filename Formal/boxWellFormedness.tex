\textbf{Well formedness}\small\\*
All the well formedness restriction of the core syntax applies here.
Moreover in a $\block$ all $\es_\vi$ except the first are not empty and only the last $\catch_\vi$ can be omitted (having an empty $\ons$).
A $\block$ can not be empty.
%The last semicolon before (\Q@]@) can be omitted
$\withKw\, \emptyset\,\emptyset\, \emptyset\,\_$ is not well formed;
$\withKw\,\xs\,\is\,\es\, %\Opt\onStart\,
\oRound\Many\onWith\Opt\block\cRound$
is well formed if the number of types $\T_\vI\ldots\T_\vn$ in each $\onKw$ is the same of the sum of the cardinalities of $\xs$, $\is$ and $\es$.
In a $\onWith$ body, variables whose type have been made more specific can still beeing updated using the more general type, thus 
a well formed $\onWith$ body can not read a variable after updating it.
In a $\withKw$, variables introduces in the $\is$ can be updated only if they are declared \Q@var@.

%Moreover, $\xs$ must be empty if  $\Many{\onWith}$ is empty.
%$\Opt\block$ is not empty if  $\Many{\onWith}$ is empty.

%There must not be any whitespace preceding the symbol `$\oRound$' in a method call of an empty method name.
There must not be any whitespace preceding the symbol `$\Terminale{"}$' in string expressions or $\Path$ in number expression.
%Terms
%$\es_\vI\catch_\vI\ldots\es_\vn\catch_\vn$ a top level inside a $\classB$ must not use keywords of form $\Outer^\vn$.

For all blocks of form
$\oCurly\es_\vI\catch_\vI\ldots\es_\vn\catch_\vn\cCurly$,
$
\SyntaxFlow{\oCurly\es_\vI\catch_\vI\ldots\es_\vn\catch_\vn\cCurly}
$
holds.
Method names in method calls (using the dot) must be of form $\x$ or $\hash\x$.

The \Q@return@ keyword can not be used inside any \Q@if@,\Q@case@ or \Q@while@ condition or inside the expression of a $\x$\Q@in@$\e$.
