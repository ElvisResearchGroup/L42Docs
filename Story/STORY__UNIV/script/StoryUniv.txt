Dylan Horrocks could be happy to look to a written founding proposal

My name is Neal Curtis and I’m a comics scholar at the University of
Auckland. I’m currently applying for funding to set up a project provisionally
called “Communicating with Comics”. Over recent years I’ve become
increasingly interested in the sub-fields of Comics Studies known as Graphic
Science, Graphic Medicine and Graphic Justice. Also, as our society becomes
increasingly influenced by conspiracy theories alternative facts, and
disinformation I feel it is important to ensure that academic research and
expert knowledge, as well as new discoveries and exciting areas of practical
and intellectual endeavor find their way to a broad range of audiences and
diverse publics. I have begun to talk to colleagues about the communicative
and storytelling potential of comics, and have already received a lot of
interest. Hence, I’m looking to build up a community of comics creators and
illustrators with an interest in comics who might be able to help realise some
really important work. At this stage, you are not committing yourself to
anything and, of course, the funding may not come together. If it does,
though, we will work towards commissioning artists, which would include
being paid to take part in “ideation” workshops where we work through which
specific comics we would like to develop. If you are interested, please email
me (n.curtis@auckland.ac.nz) and we can hopefully start something exciting.

-- World building

Eugene Mortis had a proof for climate change will destroy us and
a  non-constructive existence proof, basically a zero information proof
showing that it is sufficient to build a pillar in the right place with a strong magnetic field
to, overtime, divert the currents of air and flush a large amount of CO2 and methane in the brine of the poles.

Even with all his (brain)power, Eugene could not get to calculate the location for such a pillar.

So, supported by a secret branch of the united nations, he got permissions to build
a fantastic Computer Science univeristy, with the goal of forging the most powerful programmer 
that ever existed, someone that will surpass him and discover the coordinates to save the world.

This whole process is secret, in order to both avoid setting the word into panic and to hide the
incredibly harsh coditions and challenges those students are experiencing.


The univerisity is in a city on the coast, an island near the cost with a literal ivory tower.

Year 1: Freshman city;
the great die off year, where most students fail and simply leave the univeristy.
The freshmans live in a little city near the island, where the freshman university campus is located.
They can see the looming ivory tower but they can not enter in it.
Lectures travel between the island and the mainland with various kinds of boats/helycopeters/fantastic transport.

Year 2: students have access to the ivory tower.
They however, can not leave any more, they are all prisoner of the island.
Students can repeat the second/third year many many times, but if it is eventually clear that can not keep up with the insane tests are offered to work on the island, to make food, to clean and to serve in bars.
Many little activities are availalbe there.
The local winery, students are advised to avoid, actually serves some experimental and dangerous brain enhacing drugs mixed up with the wine.
The fact that students are prisoners is actually a secret to the students there, and the 'employers' have to keep the secret.
Those employers were are all great programmers once apon a time, but they only know about older styles of SW develepements, and so they can not handle the newer tests.
So everyone on the island is an ex student (or a lecturer?)

Year 3: ??? final projects? actually getting publications?

The lecturers in this univeristy are all obeying Mortis because of fear and they are actually quite regretfull that they have to make those poor students suffer soo much, but they are too scared to act, for one reason or another, they all have too much to lose.

All of the world set up is a secret, but any chapter that could be some programming puzzles where the solution can point to the nature of the univeristy

It would be nice if at the start of the course every student was to receive an identical new shiny colorful backback looking a little like a super hero gadget.

-- The story

Our Hero (Dany/Daniel?/Simon) is a coward and weak boy, and have no clue that going to this university is actually
like falling into an eternal trap.
His Friend Rick from the high school is enrolling with him.

Dany soon develops a super power. Super powers in this world are all about 'powers of the mind',
that can not be really proved to exists by experiments.
Dany power let him have fantastic allucinations that work as great
explanations/visualizations for the atrociusly hard task of learning programming.
Other students may be able to 'stop time' to think longer on problems, see other people auras,
see other people skills, some light form of premonition, the power to focus deeply but for short times,
the power to make other people deeply self aware and sharper but at the cost of their mental stability, 
great intuition on how things are designed internally,
making accurate guesses on phisics phenomenas (Fermi estimations) 
sealing people capacities,
having lucid dreams where you can design plans and simulate outcomes,
just screming very hard to get temporarily smarter


Freshmen city: In the first lecture, the lecturer says that a problem is impossible, and with his first
allucation Dany discover that is wrong, and shows the lecturer the solution.
The lecturer does not belive Dany and publicly mock him. Dany shows that he is right and
the class claps while the lecturer has to run away in shame.

From that day Dany is often called with surprise interrogations and he has to challenge many difficoult questions with his success on the line.

One day he makes a 'guide' on how to solve a kind of problem for a coming assignent, and the lecturer (another one?) confirms that this 'guide' is correct. He gives the guide to the class, but there was actually an error in the guide and so the whole class failed.
Dany then had to regain the trust of the whole class, student by student, by working as a tutor for them and giving them personalized explanations for many concepts.

There is a moment where Rick is so pissed for how the lecturers are treating Dany that he break/vandalize the car of the bad lecturer, and he got into some kind of detention.
Somehow with a challenge about coding Dany manage to free him (may be Dany have to teach him coding so that he can pass the challenge himself?)


Usually, the freshman year havean 80% failure rate and thus 80% of all the students had to leave, while
the 20% is going to the island.

Finally, thanks to Dany, for the first time in forever, most of the class pass the first year.
Sadly, this means that they are all going to be secretly trapped in the Island, and they are not as good as the as the usual students that pass, they were simply able to learn better because of Dany great explanations...
One of the lecturers get fired because they where unable to fail enough students.
One of the lecturers (a girl) get 'converted' to be a good person and help the students in the final exam,
but it is a first year lecturer and so she end up staying on the city and will not be seen any more.

In the second year, they discover a lot about the Island
in one arc we could explore the 'experimental' wine and the conseguences
may be Rick was a wine taster and so discovers that something is wrong.

in one arc an 'employer/clener' may give suspisciusly good coding advice
in one arc they may discover about the 'prison' nature of the island and some student may try to escape

In the third year, Dany get to 'fight' directly agains Eugene Mortis, with some initial success, but eventually Eugine wins and by discussing the real reasons for the existence of the univercity makes Dany into an obedient Pawn.

There is a conference many of the students manage to travel to, and this could be a great occasion to escape.
Dany however manages to block them so that they are forced back, so that they can study more and grow better.
Just after coming back, one of the students that really looked forward to escape may suicide or do some lesser self harm.
Another option could be that this student dies of 'overstress' on the fly black.
This event shock Dany and bring him back on the 'good side', but he will forever lose his self confidence

If we decide for an happy ending, we could make that the power to see the future goes into play, and
Dany somehow gets a realistic allucination about the future impact of his actions, and he change his mind
letting the other students free. We can then remind the audience that if they staied instead, they could have been the ones saving the world.

Finally we could have a conclusion, where Dany tells everyone about the real purpose of the university and
the plans of Eugine, and all the students confront Eugine in some philosophical battle, where eventually 
Eugine offers them to become professors and to teach there, but they refuse.
Instead they decide to keep studying and to fight to save the world, at the condition that Eugine abandon his role as headmaster and becomes a student again too.
