if I want to restart an SVG animation I can do `document.getElementById('animation').beginElement()`
But what if I have a list of animationIds that I want to restart?
---
If you have a list of animation IDs that you want to restart, you can use a for loop to iterate over the list of IDs and call the beginElement() method on each one.

Here's an example:

// This is a list of animation IDs that you want to restart
const animationIds = ['animation1', 'animation2', 'animation3'];

// Loop through the list of animation IDs
for (const animationId of animationIds) {
  // Get the animation element by its ID
  const animationElement = document.getElementById(animationId);
  
  // Restart the animation by calling the beginElement() method
  animationElement.beginElement();
}

This code will loop through the list of animation IDs, find the corresponding animation elements, and restart each animation by calling the beginElement() method on each element.
--------------
can we make a one liner?
------------
Yes, you can use the Array.prototype.forEach() method to iterate over the list of animation IDs and call the beginElement() method on each one in a single line of code.

Here's an example:

// This is a list of animation IDs that you want to restart
const animationIds = ['animation1', 'animation2', 'animation3'];

// Use the forEach() method to iterate over the list of animation IDs and restart each animation
animationIds.forEach(animationId => document.getElementById(animationId).beginElement());

This code will do the same thing as the previous example, but it uses the forEach() method to iterate over the list of animation IDs and call the beginElement() method on each one in a single line of code.
-----------------
So, why you suggested me the longer version before? what is the best way?
--------------------
I suggested the longer version of the code because it is more explicit and easier to understand than the one-line version. In general, it is often better to write code that is easy to read and understand, even if it takes up more lines. This is especially true when you are working on a team, or if you need to look back at your code at a later time.

Having said that, there are times when a one-line version of the code can be useful, such as when you need to write a quick and simple script. In that case, the one-line version of the code can be a good solution.

Ultimately, the best way to write the code will depend on your specific needs and preferences. If you prefer a more concise and compact version of the code, then the one-line version may be the best option for you. But if you prefer a more explicit and readable version of the code, then the longer version may be a better choice.
----------
I agree that the code should be readable, but how can the long version be more readable? it has the same conceptual complexity, right?
-----------------
While it's true that the one-line and longer versions of the code have the same conceptual complexity, the longer version is often easier to read and understand because it is more explicit. In the longer version, each step of the process is broken down into separate lines of code, which makes it easier to see what is happening at each step.

For example, in the longer version of the code, the for loop and the call to the beginElement() method are each on their own line of code. This makes it easier to see that the code is looping through the list of animation IDs and restarting each animation. In the one-line version of the code, these two steps are combined into a single line of code, which can make it harder to see what is happening at a glance.

Another advantage of the longer version is that it is easier to add comments to explain what the code is doing. In the longer version, you can add comments above or below each line of code to explain what that line of code does. This can be helpful for other people who may be reading your code, or for yourself if you need to come back to the code at a later time.

Overall, the longer version of the code is often more readable because it is more explicit and easier to follow. It may take up more lines of code, but it can make it easier to understand what the code is doing.
----------------
You can still put the code on multiple lines even in the shorter version, like
```
animationIds.forEach(animationId => 
    document.getElementById(animationId).beginElement()
    );
```
So, I'm not sure I understand your point.

You are correct that you can still put the code on multiple lines in the one-line version, as you have shown in your example. This can make the code easier to read and understand, and it can also allow you to add comments to explain what each line of code does.

However, even when the code is written on multiple lines like this, the one-line version still has the disadvantage of being more compact and less explicit than the longer version. In the one-line version, the forEach() method and the call to the beginElement() method are still combined into a single line of code, which can make it harder to see what is happening at a glance.

In contrast, in the longer version of the code, the for loop and the call to the beginElement() method are each on their own line of code, which makes it easier to see what is happening at each step. This can make the longer version of the code more readable, even when it is written on multiple lines.

Ultimately, the best way to write the code will depend on your specific needs and preferences. If you prefer a more concise and compact version of the code, then the one-line version may be the best option for you. But if you prefer a more explicit and readable version of the code, then the longer version may be a better choice.
------------
Are you contrasting 'explicit' with 'using lambdas' or is there something else that makes the longer code 'explicit'? how would you define 'explicit'
-----------
When I say that the longer version of the code is more explicit, I am referring to the fact that it is more clear and detailed in its explanation of what the code is doing. The longer version of the code is more explicit because it breaks down the process into separate steps, each of which is written on its own line of code. This makes it easier to see what is happening at each step, and it can make the code easier to understand.

In contrast, the one-line version of the code is less explicit because it combines multiple steps into a single line of code. This can make it harder to see what is happening at a glance, and it can make the code more difficult to understand.

The use of lambda expressions in the one-line version of the code is not directly related to the concept of explicitness. Lambda expressions can be useful for writing concise and compact code, but they can also make the code harder to read and understand if they are not used carefully. In the case of the one-line version of the code, the use of a lambda expression does not make the code more or less explicit, but it does make the code more compact.

In general, the word "explicit" means clear and detailed in its explanation or description. When applied to code, the term "explicit" can refer to code that is clear and easy to understand because it breaks down the process into separate steps and explains each step in detail. In contrast, "implicit" code is less clear and detailed in its explanation, and it may require the reader to infer or guess what the code is doing.
------
would you say that 'declarative' code is less 'explicit'?
---------
Declarative code is a type of code that is written in a way that describes what the code should do, rather than how it should do it. Declarative code is often contrasted with imperative code, which is written in a way that specifies the steps that the code should take to accomplish a task.

Declarative code can be less explicit than imperative code because it does not always provide a detailed explanation of how the code is achieving its desired result. Instead, declarative code focuses on describing what the code should do, without explaining the specific steps that the code is taking to accomplish that goal. This can make declarative code more concise and abstract, but it can also make it harder to understand and debug.

For example, consider the following declarative code that sorts a list of numbers:

// Declarative code to sort a list of numbers
const numbers = [3, 7, 1, 5, 2];
const sortedNumbers = numbers.sort();

This code uses the Array.prototype.sort() method to sort the list of numbers. The sort() method is a declarative way of sorting the list, because it simply describes what the code should do (i.e., sort the list), without explaining the specific steps that the code is taking to accomplish that goal.

In contrast, consider the following imperative code that sorts a list of numbers:

// Imperative code to sort a list of numbers
const numbers = [3, 7, 1, 5, 2];
const sortedNumbers = [];

while (numbers.length > 0) {
  // Find the minimum number in the list
  let min = Math.min(...numbers);

  // Remove the minimum number from the list
  numbers = numbers.filter(num => num !== min);

  // Add the minimum number to the sorted list
  sortedNumbers.push(min);
}

This code uses a while loop and several other imperative statements (e.g., push(), filter()) to sort the list of numbers. This code is more explicit than the declarative version because it provides a detailed explanation of the steps that the code is taking to sort the list.

Overall, declarative code can be less explicit than imperative code because it does not always provide a detailed explanation of how the code is achieving its desired result. However, declarative code can also be more concise and abstract, which can make it easier to write and maintain in some cases. The best approach to take will depend on the specific needs and goals of your project.
-------------
In the future, where language models like you would be serving a much bigger role and writing and maintaining code, would the 'declarative' or the 'imperative' style be the best way forward?
-------------------

It is difficult to predict exactly how language models like me will be used in the future, or what the best way to write and maintain code will be. However, it is likely that both declarative and imperative styles of programming will continue to be important, and that different approaches will be suitable for different types of tasks and projects.

Declarative code can be useful for expressing complex algorithms and logic in a concise and abstract way. This can make it easier to write and maintain the code, and it can also make it easier for other people to understand and work with the code. In addition, declarative code can be more resilient to changes in the underlying data or environment, because it focuses on describing what the code should do, rather than how it should do it.

However, declarative code can also have some limitations. For example, declarative code can be less explicit than imperative code, which can make it harder to understand and debug in some cases. In addition, declarative code may not be as flexible or adaptable as imperative code, because it is more abstract and less detailed in its explanation of how the code is achieving its desired result.

In contrast, imperative code can be useful for expressing complex algorithms and logic in a detailed and step-by-step way. This can make the code more explicit and easier to understand, which can be helpful for debugging and maintenance. In addition, imperative code can be more flexible and adaptable than declarative code, because it provides a detailed explanation of the steps that the code is taking to accomplish a task.

However, imperative code can also have some disadvantages. For example, imperative code can be longer and more complex than declarative code, which can make it harder to write and maintain. In addition, imperative code can be more brittle and less resilient to changes in the underlying data or environment, because it is written in a way that specifies the steps that the code should take to accomplish a task.

In the future, it is likely that both declarative and imperative styles of programming will continue to be important and useful, and that different approaches will be suitable for different types of tasks and projects. Language models like me may be able to assist with writing and maintaining code in both styles, but ultimately the choice of which style to use will depend on the specific needs and goals of the project.
