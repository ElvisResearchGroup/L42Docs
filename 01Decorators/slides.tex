\frametitle{Minimal building block}
To manipulate libraries we do not use any templating mechanism.
Libraries can be composed with other libraries using an algebra of composition operators /decorators.
The main one is \Q@Compose@, that decorates a class by summing to it a list of libraries. It is the only one that uses multiple libraries.\\*
\Q@Compose[a;b;c]<<d@ composes \Q@a b c d@. Abstract methods can be implemented, nested classes with the same name are recursively summed.

\PresentationOnly\pause On default the composition is symmetric, but \Q@Compose@ can take options to automatically solve conflicts (i.e. same method implemented in multiple classes). For example, a right preferential strategy.

Note that generated libraries are decorated copies of old ones.
\\*
Pre-existing code is never modified.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Minimal building block}

In addition to compose there are a plethora of \alert{refactoring} operators, that takes a single library and adapt it somehow.
\begin{itemize}
\PresentationOnly\pause\item \Q@RenamePath@ and \Q@RenameSelector@ rename nested classes and methods
\PresentationOnly\pause\item \Q@RemoveImplementationPath@  make a nested class (and the whole subtree) fully abstract. (See also \Q@RemoveImplementationSelector@)
\PresentationOnly\pause\item \Q@Redirect@ delete a  nested class and redirect all the reference to it to an external one.
\PresentationOnly\pause\item \Q@Introspect@ is a class allowing to query a library on its methods and nested classes names and structural shapes.
\PresentationOnly\pause\item \Q@MakePrivatePath@ and \Q@MakePrivateSelector@ to tune privateness.
\PresentationOnly\pause\item \Q@AddDocumentationPath@, \Q@AddDocumentationSelector@, \Q@RemoveDocumentationPath@, \Q@RemoveDocumentationSelector@
support generation of documentation with metaprogramming.

Multiple incompatible collections can be generated for the same type, in order to underline a different role for different collections.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Collection generation / not with generics}
Thanks to \Q@Refactor::Redirect@ we can emulate generics, just redirect a class to the final destination.
Internally, the code of \Q@Collections.vector@ may look like the following
\begin{NiceCode}{59ex}{0.8}
\begin{lstlisting}
Collection:{...
  Library vector(type Any that){
    return Refactor::Redirect[Path"T" to: that ]<<{()
      T:{}
      method Void add(T that){...}
     ...}
    }
  }
\end{lstlisting}
\end{NiceCode}
And the result of \Q@NVec:Collections.vector(N)@ could be:
\begin{NiceCode}{59ex}{0.8}
\begin{lstlisting}
$\Comment{NVec:Collections.vector(N)}$
NVec:{()
  method Void add(N that){...}
  ...}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{NiceCode}


Note how in this way we only need a simple nominal type system.
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Pseudo higher order functions}
In the same way, it would be possible to have maps/filters/folds as in functional languages, without the need of polymorphic types
\begin{NiceCode}{59ex}{0.8}
\begin{lstlisting}
myStudents= PersonList[....]
FindOlder: Accumulate[PersonList]<<{
  method Person accumulate (Person left, Person right){
    if left.age()>right.age() ( return left )
    return right
  }}
older= FindOlder.from(myStudents)
$\Comment{haskell-like equivalent}$
$\Comment{older=accumulate (left,right->if left.age()>right.age() left else right) myStudents}$
\end{lstlisting}

While do not look as nice as an haskell-like equivalent,
our approach works with a simple pure nominal type system.
\\*

Is it easier to reason about decorators as producing code taking some hint in input, or
is it easier to reason about higher order polymorphic function composition?
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Compose}
 \Q@Compose@ decorates a class by summing to it a list of libraries.
Since there is no ``extends'', code reuse is obtained with decorators.
For example, to define a gui with callbacks, we can have a html form where buttons have ids, and we can implement the onclick method:

%Test this code in the prototype!
%should be ok with Gui g and give type error with Outer1 g
\begin{NiceCode}{59ex}{0.8}
\begin{lstlisting}
Gui:Compose[GuiFromHtml(myHtml)]<<{
  ButtonStart:{ method Void onClick(Gui g){
    g.resultText().value(g.inputText().value())   }}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{NiceCode}

\Q@GuiFromHtml@ have a set of conventions: generate nested classes for elements with associated events, and getters for elements with an \Q@id@ attribute.\\*
The programmer can/must rely on those conventions!\\*
As an alternative design, \Q@GuiFromHtml@ could be a decorator; this it could examine the input code and check conventions are respected.
\begin{NiceCode}{59ex}{0.8}
\begin{lstlisting}
Gui:GuiFromHtml[myHtml]<<{
  ButtStart:{ method Void onClick(Gui g){$\Comment{error is discovered}$
    g.resultText().value(g.inputText().value())   }}
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Resolver}
The need of super is satisfied with resolvers. In the following code
\begin{NiceCode}{59ex}{0.8}

  { method Bool a(){return True()} };
  { method Bool a(){return False()} };
  resolver:{
    Bool a(){return this.left() & this.right()}
    Bool left()
    Bool right()  
    };
  ]
\end{lstlisting}

The \Q@Compose@ instance will compose the two classes successfully and
the resulting method \Q@a()@ will perform the logic and of the result of the two methods.

\frametitle{Today, a goal for tomorrow}
The shift of mind that I'm suggesting here is similar to the one from imperative to object oriented programming.
\begin{itemize}
\item With OO, thanks to dynamic dispatch, the programmer do not chose explicitly what behaviour to invoke when a method is called.\\*
(as in \Q@a.draw(b)@)\\*
However, the programmers are still in control, since they are instantiating and passing around such objects.
\PresentationOnly\pause\item With class decorators, the programmers do not chose explicitly what methods are in each class.\\*

However, the programmers are still in control, since they writing and applying such decorator objects.
