A class decorator is an object offering  a method named \Q@<@ that takes a library (=a class with nested classes) and return a library; that is:\\*

Since class decorator tends to have many options, they can be instantiated using the square brackets, as in \Q@Data[...optionName1:value1;optionName2:value2;...]@  .\\*

\frametitle{Minimal building block}
To manipulate libraries we do not use any templating mechanism.
Libraries can be composed with other libraries using an algebra of composition operators /decorators.
The main ones are \Q@Use@ and \Q@Adapt@
\begin{itemize}
\item \Q@Use@ decorates a class by summing to it a list of libraries.
\\*
\Q@Use[a;b;c]<d@ composes in a symmetrical way \Q@a b c d@. Abstract methods can be implemented, nested classes with the same name are recursivly summed.
\Q@Use@ can take options to resolve conflicts (i.e. same method implemented in multiple classes)
\item \Q@Adapt@ decorates a class by renaming/making private methods and nested classes.
Is it also possible to delete a  nested class and redirect all the reference to it to an external one.
\\*
\Q@ Adapt[Name"foo()" into:Name"bar()"]<d@
 adapts \Q@d@ so that the method \Q@foo()@ is now called \Q@bar()@ (as in refactoring).
\item \Q@Introspect@ is a class allowing to query a library on its methods and nested classes names and structural shapes.

\end{itemize}
Generated libraries are decorated copies of old ones.
\\*
Pre-existing code is never modified.

StudentList:Collection.orderedList(Student, orderedBy:{
  method Boolean(Student a, Student b) {return a.name>b.name}
  })
\end{lstlisting}
\end{NiceCode}
Collections are generated on demand one for each different type.
Multiple incompatible collections can be generated for the same type, in order to underline a different role for different collections.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Collection generation / not with generics}
Thanks to \Q@Adapt@ we can emulate generics, just redirect a class to the final destination.
Internally, the code of \Q@Collection.vector@ may look like the following
\begin{NiceCode}{59ex}{0.8}
\begin{lstlisting}
Collection:{...
  Library vector(type Any that){
    return Adapt[Name"T" into:Name(that) ]<{()
      T:{}
      method Void add(T that){...}
     ...}
    }
  }
\end{lstlisting}
\end{NiceCode}
And the result of \Q@NVec:Collection.vector(N)@ could be:
\begin{NiceCode}{59ex}{0.8}
\begin{lstlisting}
$\Comment{NVec:Collection.vector(N)}$
NVec:{()
  method Void add(N that){...}
  ...}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{NiceCode}


Note how in this way we only need a simple nominal type system.
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Pseudo higher order functions}
In the same way, it would be possible to have maps/filters/folds as in functional languages, without the need of polymorphic types
\begin{NiceCode}{59ex}{0.8}
\begin{lstlisting}
myStudents= PersonList[....]
FindOlder: Accumulate[PersonList]<{
  method Person accumulate (Person left, Person right){
    if left.age()>right.age() ( return left )
    return right
  }}
older= FindOlder.from(myStudents)
$\Comment{haskell-like equivalent}$
$\Comment{older=accumulate (left,right->if left.age()>right.age() left else right) myStudents}$
\end{lstlisting}
\end{NiceCode}
While do not look as nice as an haskell-like equivalent,
our approach works with a simple pure nominal type system.
\\*
\pause
\alert{Question:}
\\*
Is it easier to reason about decorators as producing code taking some hint in input, or
is it easier to reason about higher order polymorphic function composition?
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Use}
 \Q@Use@ decorates a class by summing to it a list of libraries.
Since there is no ``extends'', code reuse is obtained with decorators.
For example, to define a gui with callbacks, we can have a html form where buttons have ids, and we can implement the onclick method:

%Test this code in the prototype!
%should be ok with Gui g and give type error with Outer1 g
\begin{NiceCode}{59ex}{0.8}
\begin{lstlisting}
Gui:Use[GuiFromHtml(myHtml)]<{
  ButtonStart:{ method Void onClick(Gui g){
    g.resultText().value(g.inputText().value())   }}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{NiceCode}

\Q@GuiFromHtml@ have a set of conventions: generate nested classes for elements with associated events, and getters for elements with an \Q@id@ attribute.\\*
The programmer can/must rely on those conventions!\\*
As an alternative design, \Q@GuiFromHtml@ could be a decorator; this it could examine the input code and check conventions are respected.
\begin{NiceCode}{59ex}{0.8}
\begin{lstlisting}
Gui:GuiFromHtml[myHtml]<{
  ButtStart:{ method Void onClick(Gui g){$\Comment{error is discovered}$
    g.resultText().value(g.inputText().value())   }}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{NiceCode}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Resolver}
The need of super is satisfied with resolvers. In the following code
\begin{NiceCode}{59ex}{0.8}
\begin{lstlisting}
Use[
  { method Bool a(){return True()} };
  { method Bool a(){return False()} };
  resolver:{
    Bool a(){return this.left() & this.right()}
    Bool left()
    Bool right()  
    };
  ]
\end{lstlisting}
\end{NiceCode}
The \Q@Use@ instance will compose the two classes successfully and
the resulting method \Q@a()@ will perform the logic and of the result of the two methods.

\item refine the result depending of what you are doing (``result'' in the example)

More Decorators! 
\begin{itemize}
\item \Q@Abstract[]<{...}@ produces the skeleton of the input (that is, all the methods become abstract)
\item \Q@Load[]<{...}@ takes a library with abstract methods/classes and bind them to some predefined value.
\item \Q@Iterable[]<{...}@ using \Q@v.size()@, \Q@v(i)@ and \Q@v(i,val:e)@ adds a standard implementation of iterators for the input.
\item \Q@Optimize[]<{...}@ produces a library with the same behaviour but with better performance (this would need ast level reasoning)

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Decorator composition}
Decorators are 
 endofunctions (functions whose domain is equal to its codomain), thus function composition of two decorator produces another decorator.
This can be obtained in 42 by having decorators offering method 
\Q@<<@.

\begin{lstlisting}
Point1: Data[]<<Logging[]<{...}
Point2: Data[]<(Logging[]<{...}) $\Comment{equivalent without composition}$
\end{lstlisting}
\end{NiceCode}
\Q@Logging@ here will somehow log all the methods call of the original code, but not the ones added by \Q@Data@ itself.\\*

While it is clear the expected semantic of \Q@<@ on the result,
I'm still deciding what should be the behaviour for other operations, (as  adding more parameters).

\frametitle{Decorators instead of Quote/Unquote DSL}
What is a Quote/Unquote DSL (also known as a Templating DSL)?
Main way to do metaprogramming.
Example, Java Mint
\begin{NiceCode}{59ex}{0.8}
\begin{lstlisting}
Code<String> msg=..;
Code<Void> myCode=<|
{
  if(Foo.bar){ Foo.doBla();}
  else { `(msg) }
}
|>;
\end{lstlisting}
\end{NiceCode}
Special parenthesis \Q@<|  |>@ denotes first class code literals,
with holes, denoted by the symbol \Q@`( )@.
The holes can be filled with arbitrary expressions of \Q@Code@ type.
This is just a layer of syntactic sugar over regular 
Meta Object Protocol(MOP), that is basically an object oriented data-structure representing
an AST for the language under consideration.
Depending on the specific language,
it is possible to guarantee a range of properties on the resulting code.

\frametitle{Decorators instead of Quote/Unquote DSL}

Templating DSL: a low level mechanism for metaprogramming.\\*

The technique does not scale and is very low level.

\frametitle{Today, a goal for tomorrow}
The shift of mind that I'm suggesting here is similar to the one from imperative to object oriented programming.
\begin{itemize}
\item With OO, thanks to dynamic dispatch, the programmer do not chose explicitly what behaviour to invoke when a method is called.\\*
(as in \Q@a.draw(b)@)\\*
However, the programmers are still in control, since they are instantiating and passing around such objects.
\item With class decorators, the programmers do not chose explicitly what methods are in each class.\\*
(as in \Q@Person:Data[]<...@)\\*
However, the programmers are still in control, since they writing and applying such decorator objects.
\end{itemize}
The difference is in the which programmer keeps the control:
In both cases we have a shift: the programmers of the final application can delegate more and more control to the programmers of the libraries.
